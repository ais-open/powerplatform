# Introduction

The solution integrates a custom PCF control using React Query Builder and SQL Formatter within Power App. This control offers an intuitive interface for building SQL queries in real-time, faster, and with fewer errors. The ability to format and share queries makes the process more efficient, reducing bottlenecks and improving collaboration.

## React Query Builder

The React Query Builder is a UI component that allows users to construct complex queries visually. It abstracts the complexity of writing query conditions manually, offering a more interactive and user-friendly interface. The builder is commonly used for:

Filtering data: Users can apply filters to datasets based on various attributes.
Advanced search: Enabling custom search conditions, like filtering by ranges, multiple conditions, and various data types.
Custom queries: Allowing users to define rules based on fields, operators, and values.

## SQL Formatter

sql-formatter is an npm package that provides an easy-to-use utility for formatting SQL queries. It's designed to improve the readability and consistency of SQL code by automatically formatting queries according to customizable rules.
